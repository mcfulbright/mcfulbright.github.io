        <p>In my free time I play a variety of video games, read fantasy and sci-fi books, as well as bake anything
            imagineable.</p>
        <p>I have always been good with computers, growing up my father taught me a lot about them after he aquired a
            degree in Computer Programming.
            My mother always told me I should follow his footsteps since I was so good with computers.

        <p> Growing up as the only girl in the family, I learned to play a lot of video games and spend a lot of time
            with technology. With many career field interests, I have
            found myself enjoying Computer Information Science the most, leaning more towards the website development
            side!
        </p>
        <p>I also enjoy spending time with my nieces, nephews, and best friend.</p>
